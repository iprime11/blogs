Viper bug fixed where she put crosshair during placing the pit . 
            <br><br>
         Due to some technical bugs they put viper's pit around her 1st now its changed because its makes game difficult for other players . viper pit is so defensive and covers major grounds so the team have to play a little price before the pit is deployed.
            <br><br>
             Now its a nerf because we buffed it earlier due to technical issue so viper main is going to be sed.
